# SECTION THREE: TREATMENT MODALITIES
## Overview

Competencies articulated in this section focus on the ability of a radiation oncologist to:
- [ ] Supervise the radiation therapy planning process, including appropriate completion of planning request form, selecting appropriate patient positioning, simulation processes and techniques for a broad range of treatment planning scenarios
- [ ] Consider motion management strategies where appropriate
- [ ] Define and delineate appropriate target volumes and OARs for a broad range of treatment planning scenarios
- [ ] Prescribe appropriate radiation dose and fractionation schedule, including treatment modality and technique, OAR constraints, and image guidance
- [ ] Critically appraise radiation therapy plans and suggest improvements where necessary
- [ ] Incorporate other treatment modalities in the overall management plan of the patient, providing a rationale for their inclusion.

All competencies within Section Three require a detailed knowledge and the ability to apply this knowledge in clinical settings [D]. A [G] indicates more general knowledge, and minimal application of this knowledge, is required.
