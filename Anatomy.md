    3. 3.3 Neurological pathways.
4. Discuss important deviations from normal, either developmental or arising from iatrogenic causes
5. Identify the site or organ on specified imaging modalities, and, where relevant, identify anatomical sub- parts, major nodal stations, vascular supply/drainage, neurological pathways and adjacent anatomical relations
