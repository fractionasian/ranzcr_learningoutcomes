# SECTION FIVE: CARE OF THE ONCOLOGY PATIENT APPLIED TO SPECIFIC TUMOUR SITES
## Overview

Competencies articulated in this section focus on the ability of a radiation oncologist to:
- Develop knowledge pertaining to the individual tumour sub-types
- Apply tumour-site specific knowledge to the care of each patient to optimise:
	- Clinical assessment
	- Management, including the use of treatment modalities which will be most effective
	- Cancer-related symptom control and the minimisation of acute and late side-effects
	- Clinical outcome and the patient’s continuing care.

It is acknowledged that radiation therapy plays a more significant role in the management of some tumour sub-types compared with others. Division of tumour categories into major and minor focus areas reflect this.

All competencies within Section Five require a detailed knowledge and the ability to apply this knowledge in clinical settings [D]. A [G] indicates that more general knowledge, and minimal application of this knowledge, is required.

In relation to staging systems, specific staging systems are referred to for many tumour sites. It is acknowledged that staging systems are updated frequently and in day-to-day clinical practice, radiation oncologists are not expected to commit required detail to memory. While the learning outcomes refer to the trainee being able to discuss the various staging systems, more specifically trainees are expected to know of the relevant staging system; how to access the current version, determine when it was updated, and apply it to the assessment of a patient’s condition.

## PAEDIATRIC

### Paediatric Cancers

The spectrum of paediatric cancer is unique because it is not defined by histological entity but by age (generally accepted as <16 years).
Although paediatric patients and tumours are infrequently seen in a radiation oncology practice, the fundamental reasons for all trainees achieving a good level of knowledge in this area are so that trainees:
- Develop an appreciation of managing malignancy in the developing child, focusing on the long-term consequences of treatment choices, in particular ‘survivorship’
- Consider issues related to delegated consent.

The management of children with differing cancers follows a basic pattern of minimising radiation with its potent long-term consequences whilst maintaining or improving cure rates. This is well illustrated by the changes in the management of acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly when contrasted with the adult setting.

The specific malignancies that trainees should have most detailed knowledge of are:
